# MultiThreadTalk

**Technologies**: Java, Socket Programming, Multithreading, Java Swing

## Overview

MultiThreadTalk is a multithreaded chat application built in Java that facilitates real-time group communication. It supports multiple users and ensures low-latency performance with the use of socket programming and multithreading techniques. The application includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing for smooth and intuitive navigation.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Enables seamless group communication in real-time with low latency.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Designed with Java Swing, providing a simple, easy-to-use interface for efficient interaction.
- **Multithreading**: Uses multithreading to handle multiple users simultaneously, improving application responsiveness.
- **Socket Programming**: Integrates socket programming to establish direct communication between users over a network.
- **Stress Testing**: The application was stress-tested with multiple concurrent users to ensure high performance and minimal latency.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the application.
- **Socket Programming**: For establishing communication between clients.
- **Multithreading**: To allow multiple users to communicate simultaneously.
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
